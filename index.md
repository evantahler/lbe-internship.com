**The ETC Internship for Location-Based Creative Good** is for graduate students of [Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center](http://etc.cmu.edu/) who are looking to gain experience with real-world Location-Based Entertainment (LBE) projects while making a positive impact on the world around us.

The 2013-2014 School Year is the first year of this endowment.  This year, we are tying to raise only $15,000.  This amount will be given to the winning student so that they may complete their project.  After the success of our first year, we will be attempting to raise more funds in order to create a sustainable program.

There are many establishments with the mission is the enrichment of society.  More often than not, these museums, libraries, and other civic institutions are non-profit, and cannot afford to keep up with modern educational and entertainment trends.  ETC students have wished to spend time working with these institutions, but have been unable to bear the financial burden of doing so.

The goal of **The ETC Internship for Location-Based Creative Good** is to allow these students to spend a summer working with the institution of their choice creating a difference.  Long-term, the goal is to raise the funds necessary to create an endowment which can afford to fund one student each summer to make this journey.
