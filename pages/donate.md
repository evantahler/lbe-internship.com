# Donate

#### For the 2013-2014 School Year, we are trying to raise **$15,000**.  We are currently at **0%** of our goal.

The 2013-2014 School Year is the first year of this endowment.  This year, we are tying to raise only $15,000.  This amount will be given to the winning student so that they may complete their project.  After the success of our first year, we will be attempting to raise more funds in order to create a sustainable program.  

We are working with the [Carnegie Mellon University Alumni House](http://alumni.cmu.edu/) to provide a safe and secure method of donating to **The Endowed Internship for Location-Based Creative Good.** 

Your donation can be made by check or credit card on the Carnegie Mellon University Alumni Website.  Carnegie Mellon is a non-profit educational institution, which makes any donations tax-deductible.  Please check if your employer does non-profit gift matching, as you may be eligible to double your donation.
