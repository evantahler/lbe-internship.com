# Donate

#### We are trying to raise **$50,000**.  
#### We are currently at **11%** of our goal.

All funds contributed will support the winning student or students so that they may complete a summer internship project.  Donations received by March 31, 2014 will be given to the winning student or students. 
 
[Donate](https://securelb.imodules.com/s/1410/giving/form.aspx?sid=1410&gid=1&pgid=382&cid=990&appealcode=A2125&dids=176) by check or credit card at the Carnegie Mellon University website.  All donations to CMU are tax-deductible.  Double your donation - check with your employer to see if matching funds are availalble! 

**Our goal is to endow this fund, which requires a $50,000 commitment; should the endowed fund not be fully committed, gifts to this fund will be used to establish an expendable internship fund.**
