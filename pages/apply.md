# Apply

Are you a current student at [Carnegie Mellon's Entertainment Technology Center](http://etc.cmu.edu/) who is looking to apply for this endowed internship?  We are happy to see you here!

We are currently working on our application and judging process, and we will let you know once we have determined a fair way to process the applications.  Please register your interest via the link below.

Our goal is to formalize this process by the end of 2013, so that students may begin the application process in the fist semester of 2014.  We hope to have both the funding round closed and the applications processed by **March 2014**.

Here is the plan so far:

## What do I win?

- Mentorship from ETC Alumni involved in this endowment
  - The Alumni have pledged their time and expertise to the winner of this endowment.  The winning student(s) can expect:
  - on-site visits to Alumni offices
  - virtual mentorhsip on the project
  - weekly progress meetings
  - and other support through the duration of the summer
  - See the [About Page](/pages/about.html) to see our team
- The student(s) who win the endowment will be granted $15,000 (or the entirety of the funds raised by this endowment if less than that amount) to allocate and spend how they see fit to accomplish their goals
  - The winners are expected to spend the money to cover their own expenses, including but not limited to: lodging, travel, food and other personal expenses
  - The student may also choose to spend the funds on material expenses for their project


## Pitch Guidelines

  - Help an existing non-profit LBE client enhance, repair, or otherwise "level up" their physical location(s)
  - Help an existing non-profit LBE client enhance, repair, or otherwise "level up" their digital presence
  - Create positive press and "buzz" for the client
  - Enhance the positive public image for Carnegie Mellon University, the Entertainment Technology Center, and this endowment. 
- This report is to be published by the student on this website
- This report is to be delivered to the faculty of the ETC, and presented to thier classmates if possible.

## Deliverables

- By September 2014, the winning student(s) are expected to deliver a report detailing:
  - project pitch
  - project implementation details
  - project analysts (were the goals met?)
  - funding allocation
- The winning student(s) are also expected to contribute their time to mentoring future winners of this endowment 

## Rules:

- All applicants must be currently enrolled ETC Students (either first or second semester)
- The winner of this endowment will be expected to work on their project with their client for the entirety of the summer semester.  
- The winner is expect to have no other summer jobs / clients than their pitched project
- Students must be eligible to work in the country / location of their project pitch

## Judging:

- The committee which determines the winning applications will be comprised of both ETC Faculty and ETC alumni

- Student pitches will be judged on the Pitch Guidelines above
